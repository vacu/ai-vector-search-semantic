== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is OpenAI required? =

No! The plugin works great with just Supabase for fast keyword search. OpenAI is only needed for semantic (AI) search and enhanced recommendations. You can start with keyword search and add semantic features later.

= How much does it cost to run? =

**Supabase:** Free tier includes 50,000 monthly queries - perfect for most stores. Paid plans start at $25/month for high-traffic sites.

**OpenAI:** One-time embedding cost of ~$0.05-$1.00 per 1,000 products. After initial setup, ongoing costs are minimal (only for new products).

= Will this slow down my site? =

No! Search queries run on Supabase's fast PostgreSQL infrastructure, not your WordPress server. This often makes search faster than default WooCommerce.

= Does it work with my theme? =

Yes! The plugin uses standard WordPress and WooCommerce hooks. It includes special integration for Woodmart theme's live search feature.

= Can I customize the search behavior? =

Absolutely! The plugin is built with developer hooks and filters. Need custom field indexing or search logic? Check our Premium setup service for advanced customization.

= What happens to my data if I uninstall? =

Your product data remains in your Supabase project - you have full control. The WordPress plugin only removes its settings and stops syncing. You can delete data from Supabase manually if desired.

= Is it GDPR compliant? =

The plugin only syncs product data (names, descriptions, prices, etc.) - no personal customer information. When semantic search is enabled, product text is processed by OpenAI according to their privacy policy.

= Can I use this on multiple stores? =

Yes! Each store gets its own unique Store ID, allowing multiple WooCommerce sites to use the same Supabase project while keeping data separate.

### Hooks and Filters

**Actions:**
- `aivesese_product_synced` - Fired when a product is successfully synced
- `aivesese_batch_complete` - Fired when a batch sync is completed

**Filters:**
- `aivesese_product_data` - Modify product data before syncing
- `aivesese_search_results` - Filter search results before display

### Database Schema

The plugin creates the following in your Supabase project:

- Vector similarity indexes for semantic search
- RPC functions for search and recommendations
- Row-level security policies for data protection

### Performance Tuning

For large catalogs (10,000+ products):
- Use batch sync instead of full sync
- Consider upgrading to Supabase Pro for better performance
- Monitor embedding generation costs during initial setup
- Implement custom caching strategies if needed
