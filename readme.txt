ðŸš€ Transform your WooCommerce search with AI-powered semantic search. Get smarter product recommendations and blazing-fast search results.

== Description ==

**AI Vector Search** revolutionizes your WooCommerce store's search experience by combining traditional keyword search with cutting-edge semantic AI technology. Built on Supabase's powerful PostgreSQL backend with optional OpenAI embeddings, it delivers lightning-fast, highly relevant search results that understand customer intent, not just keywords.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

**Smart Search Technology:**
* **Full-Text Search (FTS)** - Lightning-fast PostgreSQL-powered keyword matching
* **Semantic Vector Search** - AI understanding of product meaning and context using OpenAI embeddings
* **SKU & GTIN Search** - Find products by partial SKU, EAN, UPC, or ISBN codes
* **Hybrid Search** - Combines multiple search methods for best results
* **Instant Lite Mode** - Built-in TF-IDF engine with synonyms, stopwords, and scheduled indexing that runs without Supabase or OpenAI

**Intelligent Recommendations:**
* **Similar Products** - AI-powered product recommendations on product detail pages
* **Cart Recommendations** - Smart upsell suggestions based on cart contents
* **Category-Aware Suggestions** - Recommendations that understand product relationships

**Advanced Integrations:**
* **Woodmart Theme Support** - Seamless integration with Woodmart's live search
* **Auto-Sync** - Automatically sync products when saved/updated
* **Batch Processing** - Handle large catalogs with intelligent batching

**Developer-Friendly:**
* **Secure Key Management** - Encrypted storage of API keys with master key support
* **Row-Level Security** - Built-in Supabase RLS policies
* **Comprehensive Admin Interface** - Status monitoring, health checks, and sync tools

**Actionable Analytics & Insights:**
* **Search Analytics Dashboard** - Track search volume, success rate, CTR, and popular terms.
* **Zero-Result Alerts** - Get notified when customers search for products you do not stock yet.
* **Click Tracking** - Measure which products shoppers open after searching to refine merchandising.

### ?? Flexible Connection Modes

AI Vector Search adapts to the way you want to run search:
* **Lite (default)** - Instant, zero-config local search with the Lite engine and optional stopword/synonym tuning.
* **Self-Hosted Supabase** - Connect your own Supabase project for scalable full-text, vector, and SKU search without leaving your infrastructure.
* **Managed API Service** - Activate with a license key to let us host the stack while you manage settings in WordPress.

Switch between modes any time in **Settings  AI Supabase**. Activating the managed API prompts for your license key, while Supabase mode uses your project URL, service key, and optional OpenAI key.

### ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy First

* **Your Keys, Your Control** - All API keys stored securely in your WordPress database
* **Encrypted Storage** - Sensitive data encrypted with configurable master keys
* **No Data Lock-in** - Full control over your Supabase project and data

== Installation ==

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Install & Activate** the plugin from WordPress admin or upload manually.
2. **Use Lite Mode instantly** - search works locally out of the box. Visit **Settings  AI Supabase** to adjust Lite stopwords, synonyms, or index limits if you need to tune results.
3. **(Optional) Connect Supabase for self-hosted search:**
   - Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and start a new project.
   - Copy your project URL and service key into the plugin settings.
   - Run the built-in schema installer from the admin UI or WP-CLI.
4. **(Optional) Enable Semantic Search with OpenAI:**
   - Add your OpenAI API key to generate embeddings (self-hosted or API modes).
   - Choose the search mode that fits your catalog and budget.
5. **(Optional) Run a product sync** from **Settings  Sync Products** or with `wp aivs sync-products` when Supabase is connected.

### Command Line Tools (WP-CLI)

Speed up setup and maintenance with new WP-CLI commands (requires the PostgreSQL client and, for schema installs, the encrypted connection string saved in settings):
* `wp aivs install-schema` - install or update the Supabase schema from your WordPress server.
* `wp aivs check-schema` - verify tables, functions, and extensions are present.
* `wp aivs test-connection` - confirm credentials before running migrations.
* `wp aivs sync-products` - batch sync products after catalog changes.

You can also trigger schema installation from the admin UI; both paths use the encrypted PostgreSQL connection string you store under **Settings  AI Supabase**.

### Getting Your API Keys

**Supabase:**
1. Visit [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Go to Project Settings â†’ API

**OpenAI (Optional for Semantic Search):**
1. Visit [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Ensure billing is set up for embedding API usage

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the connection modes? =

Lite mode runs locally and is enabled by default. Switch to self-hosted Supabase when you want scalable vector search on your own infrastructure, or activate the managed API service with your license key when you prefer a fully hosted stack. You can change modes in **Settings  AI Supabase** and the plugin will guide you through any extra steps (keys, schema install, or product sync).

= Is OpenAI required? =

No! The plugin works great with just Supabase for fast keyword search. OpenAI is only needed for semantic (AI) search and enhanced recommendations. You can start with keyword search and add semantic features later.

= How much does it cost to run? =

**Supabase:** Free tier includes 50,000 monthly queries - perfect for most stores. Paid plans start at $25/month for high-traffic sites.

**OpenAI:** One-time embedding cost of ~$0.05-$1.00 per 1,000 products. After initial setup, ongoing costs are minimal (only for new products).

= Will this slow down my site? =

No! Search queries run on Supabase's fast PostgreSQL infrastructure, not your WordPress server. This often makes search faster than default WooCommerce.

= Does it work with my theme? =

Yes! The plugin uses standard WordPress and WooCommerce hooks. It includes special integration for Woodmart theme's live search feature.

= Can I customize the search behavior? =

Absolutely! The plugin is built with developer hooks and filters. Need custom field indexing or search logic? Check our Premium setup service for advanced customization.

= What happens to my data if I uninstall? =

Your product data remains in your Supabase project - you have full control. The WordPress plugin only removes its settings and stops syncing. You can delete data from Supabase manually if desired.

= Is it GDPR compliant? =

The plugin only syncs product data (names, descriptions, prices, etc.) - no personal customer information. When semantic search is enabled, product text is processed by OpenAI according to their privacy policy.

= Can I use this on multiple stores? =

Yes! Each store gets its own unique Store ID, allowing multiple WooCommerce sites to use the same Supabase project while keeping data separate.

### Hooks and Filters

**Actions:**
- `aivesese_product_synced` - Fired when a product is successfully synced
- `aivesese_batch_complete` - Fired when a batch sync is completed

**Filters:**
- `aivesese_product_data` - Modify product data before syncing
- `aivesese_search_results` - Filter search results before display

### Database Schema

The plugin creates the following in your Supabase project:
- `products` table with full-text search indexes
- Vector similarity indexes for semantic search
- RPC functions for search and recommendations
- Row-level security policies for data protection

### Performance Tuning

For large catalogs (10,000+ products):
- Use batch sync instead of full sync
- Consider upgrading to Supabase Pro for better performance
- Monitor embedding generation costs during initial setup
- Implement custom caching strategies if needed
